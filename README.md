A small tool for calculating Pressure drop in a pipe for most commonly used commercially pipes. This is my personal project i just want to put it out there if anyone want :).

i do want to add more functionality to the app when i get motivated.

Tool will only update when ever you change pipe diameter, velocity and flow rate as they are most commonly itterated.

I used Darcyâ€“Weisbach equation for calculating Pressure-drop / Head-loss and Tkachenko, Mileikovskyi's derivation for Colebrook equation for friction factor, check the following Wikipedia page for refferances.
